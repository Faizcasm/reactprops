# Card Component Project

## Overview

This project includes a reusable Card component that displays information passed as props. The cards have a gradient border and are styled for a clean look.

## Decisions Made

1. **Component Structure**: Separated concerns by creating individual components for the Card and CardList.
2. **Styling**: Used CSS for styling the cards, ensuring a gradient border and hover effects for interactivity.
3. **Deployment**: Deployed on Netlify for ease of access and sharing.
4. **Reusability**: Designed the Card component to be reusable with dynamic data passed through props.
